the future,\n","    a training process called \"teacher forcing\" in this context.\n","    It uses as initial state the state vectors from the encoder.\n","    Effectively, the decoder learns to generate `targets[t+1...]`\n","    given `targets[...t]`, conditioned on the input sequence.\n","- In inference mode, when we want to decode unknown input sequences, we:\n","    - Encode the input sequence into state vectors\n","    - Start with a target sequence of size 1\n","        (just the start-of-sequence character)\n","    - Feed the state vectors and 1-char target sequence\n","        to the decoder to produce predictions for the next character\n","    - Sample the next character using these predictions\n","        (we simply use argmax).\n","    - Append the sampled character to

BERT and Word Sense Disambiguation"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"QBsBGPfYXK_b"},"source":["In computational linguistics, word-sense disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem concerned with identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence. Imagine a bank of water, or a bank which accepts deposits. You can distinguish these two \"banks\" easily because you understand the context of the sentence which is used for it. What if we want to distinguish senses of a word automatically? You have learned about word embeddings and W2V from the [first assignment](https://iust-deep-learning.github.io/981/assignments/01_mlp_and_preprocessing). W2V extracts a unique vector that is a representation of that word. That is sufficiant we are going distinguish between two different words, such as \"Hi\" and \"Bye\"; but we cannot purely depend on it when we want to distinguish between a specific word with several senses.\n","\n","Researchers have developed several methods for tackling this issue. One of these techniques named DeConf is proposed by your professor, Dr. Pilehvar. He tackled this problem by de-conflating the representations of words based on the deep knowledge it derives from a semantic network. You can read the complete paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01961). Besides, A full survey about WSD is available [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220566219_Word_Sense_Disambiguation_A_Survey).\n","\n","In this task, we are going to distinguish between two senses of the word (noun) \"bat\" using [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). BERT is a context-aware language representation model that can produce different vectors for a specific word according to the context of the sentence.\n","\n","According to [Cambridge dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/bat), \"bat\" has two meanings:\n","1. A specially shaped piece of wood used for hitting the ball in some games (cricket bat)\n","\n","2. A small animal like a mouse with wings that flies at night (mammal bat)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"YJnVfh33_gl0"},"source":["We use two simple datasets for our task.
