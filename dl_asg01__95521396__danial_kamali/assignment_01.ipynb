pre-trained word embedding to encode the reviews. To do so, we leverage the Google News Word2Vec model, a model that provides 300 semantic features for each word. These features are extracted concerning the position of the training word and by considering adjacent words in the training data (Google News). More detailed information will be discussed in your class later.\n","\n","You can download the pre-trained model from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl4j-distribution/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz), and you may want to use [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) to load the file. Next, you need to replace the document vector with the average of word vectors that are available in the W2V model.
